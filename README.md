# Sudoku_GUI_with_Solver
This is a classic implementation of Sudoku with a solver using a backtracking algorithm and object-orientated programming (OOP). The GUI is created in Python 3 with the pygame library.

# How To Play
Use your mouse to select a box and then type a number on your keyboard to pencil mark a number. To check if that value is correct, press the ENTER key. To remove a cell's pencil mark you can simply press DEL or DELETE. If at any point the player is stuck and no longer wishes to try and solve the board, press the SPACE key, and the backtracking algorithm will visually reveal the algorithm's solving process and solution.

# Game Rules/Objective
Sudoku has four rules:
  1. Each row must contain the numbers 1-9, without any repetitions
  2. Each column must contain the numbers 1-9, without any repetitions
  3. Each nonet (the 3x3 blocks) must contain the numbers 1-9, without any repetitions
  4. DO NOT GUESS! Every Sudoku puzzle has a unique solution and the clues from the start of the game is all you need to logically solve it
